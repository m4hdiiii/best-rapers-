                Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
                I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
                Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
                But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch
                break it down, I break it down

                I break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down
                Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
                My heart so cold, I could put it in my cup
                Gang versus the world, me and my dawg, it was us
                Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
                My brother lost his life, and it turned me to a beast
                My brother got life, and it turned me to the streets
                I been through the storm, and it turned me to a G
                But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

                Fuck around with these thots? (A lot)
                break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down (yeah) (for so many reasons)
                I just came from the A, I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
                Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
                He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
                You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
                Question, how many fakin' they streams? (A lot)
                Gettin' they plays from machines? (A lot)
                I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
                Niggas ain't really big as they seem (hmm)
                I never say anythin' (nah), e'rybody got they thin' (true)
                Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (hmm)
                I'm on a money routine, I don't want smoke, I want cream
                I don't want no more comparisons, this is a marathon and I'm aware
                I been playin' it back from a lack of promotions
                I never was one for the braggin' and boastin'
                I guess I was hopin' the music would speak for itself
                But the people want everythin' else
                Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
                You know what the outcome will be, I'm battin' a thousand
                It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
                Fuck it, 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
                And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
                He call it "a lot", I open my book and I jot
                Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot, I picture him inside a cell on a cot
                'Flectin' on how he made it to the top, wonderin' if it was worth it or not
                I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
                Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
                Though I never met you, I know that you special
                And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
                Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga, I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
                I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
                When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
                They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
                Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
                Before it all ends, nigga
                How much money you got? (A lot)
                How many problems you got? (A lot)

                break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down (for so many reasons)
                I break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down
                I break it down, I break it down
