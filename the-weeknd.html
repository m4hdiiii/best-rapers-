        I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
        I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
        'Cause I love you, yeah
         It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
        But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
             Let me tell the truth
         Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
                
             You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
             You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
             You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
             I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
             I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
             I try to find a reason to pull us apart
              It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
            And I know that you're worth it
              
             Even though we're goin' through it
             And it makes you feel alone
                Just know that I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                The distance and the time between us
                It'll never change my mind 'cause
                Baby, I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say)
                
                I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
                But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
                Just don't blame me, too, yeah
                'Cause I can't take this pain forever
                And you won't find no one that's better
                'Cause I'm right for you, babe
                I think I'm right for you, babe
                
                You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
                You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
                It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
                And I know that you're worth it
                I can't walk away, oh
                
                Even though we're goin' through it
                And it makes you feel alone
                Just know that I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                The distance and the time between us
                It'll never change my mind 'cause
                Baby, I would die for you, uh
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                
                I would die for you, I would lie for you
                Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
                I'm just sayin', yeah
                I would die for you, I would lie for you
                Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
                Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
                
                Even though we're goin' through it
                And it makes you feel alone
                Just know that I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                The distance and the time between us
                It'll never change my mind 'cause
                Baby, I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)
